Real-World Impact:
- Reduce Diagnostic Errors: Mitigate diagnostic errors and delayed treatments for patients from underserved communities due to skin tone biases in dermatology AI systems.
- Improve Accessibility: Ensure equal access to accurate skin health assessments for individuals regardless of their skin tone.
